  Multi-Depot Multi-Terminal Hamiltonian Path Problem.
  All terminals are unassigned!
  In other words, there is no agent-target assignment constraints.
  Based on the tf algorithm for the MDMTSP problem.

  Input:
  N = #agents
  M = #targets
  spMat = the shortest path distance between any pair of nodes in depots U targets U destinations.
           and there should be N depots (i.e. starts), M targets, N destinations.
           The ID of depots should be 0 ~ N-1;
           The ID of targets should be N ~ N+M-1;
           The ID of destinations should be N+M ~ N+M+N-1.
  bigM = an upper bound of any possible tour cost. the lower the better.
  infM = the large integer that marks infinity. the large the better (avoid overflow).
  Ie, edges that must be included.
  Oe, edges that must be excluded.
  Ie and Oe are args that support K-best-TSP.
  
  Output:
  A cost matrix after transformation. This matrix is of size (N+M+N)x(N+M+N).
